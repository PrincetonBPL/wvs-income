# World Value Survey and Income: Evidence from 43 Countries

This is a public repository for the WVS and income cross-country study.

### Directories

The scripts rely on this particular structure. In the future we might just have you specify these are arguments. Data, notes, and other documentation is not version-controlled and can be found in the Box directory.

+ `code`: Contains scripts for cleaning raw data and running analyses.
	- `do`: Primary .do files, esttab tables.
	- `ado`: .ado files required for execution.
+ `data`: Contains data and documentation in various formats.
+ `figures`: Contains output graphs and figures.
+ `publication`: Contains materials for the paper, PAP, and online appendix.
+ `tables`: Contains output tables in .tex format.

### Scripts

Best practice is to run all Stata program through the master .do file.

### Replication

These will be instructions for replicating the paper. Will probably add a Python script.
