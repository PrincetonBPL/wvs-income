	Abstract = {The relationship between locus of control ({LC)}, grade point average ({GPA)}, standardized achievement test scores ({SAT)}, sex, and socioeconomic status ({SES)} was investigated among a sample of 174 eighth graders who responded to the Nowicki-Strickland locus on control instrument. Certain partial correlations between momentary achievement (standardized test results), continuing achievement (grade point average), sex and socioeconomic status were explicated. Utilizing sex, socioeconomic status and locus of control as independent variables, a significant interaction between sex and type of achievement was noted. When considering sex differences with {LC} scores, {GPA} was more predictable than standardized test results. However, when sex was not considered, standardized test results were as predictable as {GPA.} (Author)},

@article{robb_socioeconomic_2009,
	Abstract = {Background Socioeconomic status ({SES)} exhibits a graded relationship with health. Dispositional optimism represents a potential mediator and has been strongly linked to health, but few studies have assessed its association with {SES.} Purpose To assess the relationship between {SES} and trait optimism and pessimism in a representative community sample of older British adults. Method Community samples of adults (55--64 years) from Scotland (N = 10,650) and England (N = 5,099) registered with Primary Care Practices were mailed self-report questionnaires. Optimism was measured by the Life Orientation Test ({LOT)}, which generates a total score and positive (optimism) and negative (pessimism) subscale scores. {SES} was assessed with an individual-level index of socioeconomic deprivation based on education, housing tenure, and car ownership. Results In both samples, there was a strong {SES} gradient in the total {LOT} score, with higher {SES} being associated with higher scores. However, when pessimism and optimism subscales were analyzed separately, the gradient was strong for pessimism, but minimal for optimism. Conclusion The results suggest that lower {SES} is associated with viewing the future as containing more negative events, but there was little {SES} difference for positive events. It will be important to distinguish the roles of pessimism and optimism in other determinants of health.},
